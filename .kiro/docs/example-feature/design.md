# Design Document

## Overview

Brief overview of the feature and its purpose.

## Architecture

High-level architecture description.

## Components and Interfaces

Description of major components and how they interact.

## Data Models

Data structures and their relationships.

## Correctness Properties

*A property is a characteristic or behavior that should hold true across all valid executions of a system—essentially, a formal statement about what the system should do. Properties serve as the bridge between human-readable specifications and machine-verifiable correctness guarantees.*

### Property 1: [Property Name]

*For any* [input description], [expected behavior]

**Validates: Requirements X.Y**

## Error Handling

How errors are detected, reported, and handled.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

Approach for unit testing specific components and edge cases.

### Property-Based Testing

Approach for property-based testing to verify universal properties across all inputs.
